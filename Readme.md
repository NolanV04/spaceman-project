# Spaceman

_Players are presented with a secret word relating to code, with a hint for the word (because this is a project for a coding bootcamp). Each letter is represented by blank spaces. Five incorrect guesses, and the Spaceman dies. Do you have what it takes to save the Spaceman?_

## Next Steps:
